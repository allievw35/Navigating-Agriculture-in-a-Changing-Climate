# Navigating Agriculture in a Changing Climate

This is a project completed as part of the course Information Science at Cornell University during the Fall 2023 semester. This report allowed me to utilize data analytic techniques such as web scraping, data cleaning, linear and logistical regression, correlation heat maps, and goodness of fit tests to analyze and visualize data and findings related to how different climate events effect various crops.

This repository contains the PDF report file as well as a Jupyter Notebook python script that was used in the analysis.
